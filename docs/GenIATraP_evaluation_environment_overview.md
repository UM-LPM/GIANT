# GenIATraP - Evaluation Environment

An **evaluation environment** is a controlled digital space designed to test, train, and assess AI agents in a structured and repeatable manner. These environments provide **realistic or abstract simulations** where agents can interact, learn, and be evaluated based on their performance.

For AI research and development, an evaluation environment is essential for:

- **Testing AI behavior** in different conditions.
- **Benchmarking performance** across various AI techniques.
- **Training reinforcement learning models** through trial and error.
- **Comparing multiple AI controllers** to determine the most effective approach.

Whether the goal is **game AI, robotics, or autonomous decision-making**, an evaluation environment serves as the foundation for developing **intelligent and adaptive systems**.

## The Role of Evaluation Environments in AI Development

AI agents require structured environments where their decisions can be **observed, measured, and improved**. These environments act as **testing grounds** where different AI controllers can be compared in a **consistent and objective** way.

An effective evaluation environment should provide:

- **A Simulated World** – A digital space where AI agents operate.
- **Defined Rules & Constraints** – Clear guidelines for how AI interacts with the world.
- **Observation & Action Spaces** – Mechanisms for AI to perceive its surroundings and take actions.
- **Performance Metrics** – Methods to evaluate AI effectiveness based on predefined objectives.

For example, in a **game AI scenario**, an evaluation environment might involve a virtual arena where AI-controlled agents compete, cooperate, or solve challenges. Their success can be measured by factors like **win rate, survival time, resource collection efficiency, or adaptability** to different opponents.

## **Why Use an Existing Evaluation Environment?**

While it’s possible to create custom evaluation environments from scratch for testing and training AI agents, using an **existing evaluation environment** offers several key advantages:

1. **Time and Cost Efficiency:**
    
    Building an evaluation environment from the ground up can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. By leveraging existing ones, you can focus on developing and testing AI models without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    
2. **Proven and Reliable Frameworks:**
    
    Established evaluation environments have undergone rigorous testing and refinement, because it was previously used by many other game developers, researcher and other who wanted to explore the AI for autonomous control.
    
3. **Optimized for AI Training:**
    
    Many existing evaluation environments are specifically designed to support AI training, with built-in features like **simulation speed, parallel processing, and customizable agent behaviors**. These features are crucial for effectively training reinforcement learning models, especially when large-scale evaluations are necessary.
    
4. **Standardization and Benchmarking:**
    
    Using an existing evaluation environment ensures consistency in testing and allows for standardized benchmarks. This is essential for comparing different AI approaches in a fair and objective manner. **Existing platforms** often come with pre-designed problem domains and simulation scenarios, making it easy to evaluate performance across various models.

5. **Community Support and Development:**
    
    Popular evaluation environments have large user communities and active development teams. This support ensures **regular updates, bug fixes, and feature expansions**, giving developers access to the latest advancements in AI testing. Additionally, many platforms offer **tutorials, documentation, and sample projects** to help you get started quickly.
    
By using an existing evaluation environment, you gain the ability to **accelerate AI development**, leverage community-driven improvements, and ensure that your evaluations are robust and repeatable. This reduces the complexity of the process and allows you to focus on refining and optimizing your AI agents.

## Supported Evaluation Environments in GenIATraP
Currently, the **GenIATraP** platform supports a single evaluation environment, which is based on the powerful [**Unity Game Engine**](https://unity.com/). Unity has been chosen due to its versatility, scalability, and extensive support for both 2D and 3D environments, making it an ideal choice for simulating various problem domains for AI training and evaluation.

The Unity evaluation environment builds upon many **established functionalities** and concepts from [**ML-Agents**](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/develop), a Unity-based framework designed to facilitate machine learning workflows within Unity. By adapting these concepts, GenIATraP extends the capabilities of the Unity environment to provide broader support for the evaluation and testing of different AI controller types, including **Neural Networks, Behavior Trees, Finite State Machines, and more**.

The platform's integration with Unity allows for the seamless creation of complex environments and scenarios where AI agents can be trained, tested, and evaluated. Key features of this evaluation environment include:

- **Customizable Problem Domains**: GenIATraP enables the easy addition of new **problem domains**, whether for game-like environments, robotics, or more abstract simulations. Users can modify environments to suit their specific evaluation needs.
- **Flexible Parallelization**: Unity's integration supports various parallelization strategies, facilitating the **simultaneous training and evaluation** of multiple agents in diverse environments, thus optimizing computation time and efficiency.
- **Extensible Architecture**: The Unity evaluation environment is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to **add new sensor types, AI controllers**, and adjust simulation parameters without significant modifications to the core system.
